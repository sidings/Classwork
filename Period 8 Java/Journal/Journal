	Goal: Today, I will research the necessary parts for connecting my project's information to a database. 
	- I was able to access wampserver and phpmyadmin. I started looking up javascript and php code to try and 
		remember what I had learned last year. I have forgotten a lot so I will be writing and testing code 
		tomorrow.
