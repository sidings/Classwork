	Goal: Today, I will research the necessary parts for connecting my project's information to a database. 
	- I was able to access wampserver and phpmyadmin. I started looking up javascript and php code to try and 
		remember what I had learned last year. I have forgotten a lot so I will be writing and testing code 
		tomorrow.

	Goal: Today, there has been a change of plans. We are going to do this in Java instead. My goal today is to 
		understand what Vaadin is and how it works in conjunction with our project and Eclipse. I will also try
		to understand how databases will fit in here. Previously, we used php in our Javascript files to access
		our databases. Now, I have to figure out what to use in Java and which other programs I will need to 
		be proficient in to make the whole thing work. 
	- I have no idea what Vaadin is. However, I found out that we could use the JDBC API to access databases.
		There are tutorials online and apparently, it works with MySQL, so I will try out the tutorials and 
		learn the new syntax.

	Goal: Today, I will ask Mr. Nockles what Vaadin is and see how it applies to our project. If it doesn't apply, 
		then I need to find another method.
	- Apparently, Vaadin is used for front end conversion of Java code into Javascript. It could be useful, but we 
		have decided to apply it at the end after having all of our base code running in Eclipse. This has nothing 
		to do with my part (Database), so I will continue on my own research tomorrow. The responsibility over 
		Vaadin, if we are using it, will be designated to Veeraj because he is in charge of the front end.

	Goal: Today, I will figure out what programs I need to implement databases in my code. Something about JDBC
		and mySQL??
	- So I have found some tutorials online on how to use them in Java, but they first required me to have mySQL
		and the mySQL JDBC driver downloaded. I have the driver downloaded, but the Internet is very slow and 
		I'm getting an estimate of 2 hours for mySQL to download. I will watch some videos of what to do in the 
		meantime. 
		Update: Just spoke to Max and his group is also trying to implement databases. He brought up a good point
		that if I download mySQL, I will have to have it downloaded on every computer that I am running my chatroom
		on. His suggestion of using php didn't help because our entire project is in Java. I will look up the best
		solution at home.

	Goal: Try to workaround needing to redownload mySQL.
	- Oh, good day!!!!!! I was able to connect phpMyAdmin to Java. Now, I can access the databases through the usage 
		of wampserver. Now, I will mess around with the code to find out cool things that I can do. We are hoping to 
		store images and emojis somehow.
		
5/12/17
	Goal: Today, I will find out how to store images in a database and try it out. Also, I will further develop my
		knowledge on the different SQL related Java methods.
	- So apparently it is possible to store images in a database, but I think we have to store their file paths? I 
		was in the middle of looking this up when I got sidetracked by researching all the different methods that
		will need to be used, such as setBinaryStream, and the difference between the different data types, such as 
		PreparedStatement vs Statement vs CallableStatement. Also, I wonder how we will be ale to get the image paths
		in the midst of running the chatroom. In other words, how will the user be able to input it?
