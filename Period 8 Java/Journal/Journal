	Goal: Today, I will research the necessary parts for connecting my project's information to a database. 
	- I was able to access wampserver and phpmyadmin. I started looking up javascript and php code to try and 
		remember what I had learned last year. I have forgotten a lot so I will be writing and testing code 
		tomorrow.

	Goal: Today, there has been a change of plans. We are going to do this in Java instead. My goal today is to 
		understand what Vaadin is and how it works in conjunction with our project and Eclipse. I will also try
		to understand how databases will fit in here. Previously, we used php in our Javascript files to access
		our databases. Now, I have to figure out what to use in Java and which other programs I will need to 
		be proficient in to make the whole thing work. 
	- I have no idea what Vaadin is. However, I found out that we could use the JDBC API to access databases.
		There are tutorials online and apparently, it works with MySQL, so I will try out the tutorials and 
		learn the new syntax.

	Goal: Today, I will ask Mr. Nockles what Vaadin is and see how it applies to our project. If it doesn't apply, 
		then I need to find another method.
	- Apparently, Vaadin is used for front end conversion of Java code into Javascript. It could be useful, but we 
		have decided to apply it at the end after having all of our base code running in Eclipse. This has nothing 
		to do with my part (Database), so I will continue on my own research tomorrow. The responsibility over 
		Vaadin, if we are using it, will be designated to Veeraj because he is in charge of the front end.
